# Grapholizer Data Analysis tool
The Grapholizer Data Analysis tool was developed during the IP6 Grapholizer project.
It serves as the second step of the Grapholizer workflow. The tool takes the input produced by the Data gathering tool (see here: https://github.com/Jayrab95/Grapholizer-Data-Gathering-Tool/tree/master), vizualizes the data and allows the user to segment annotate the data.
The end result is a .csv table which contains the annotated data.
